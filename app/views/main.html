      <h3>My name is Ryan and I am a designer and a developer. </h3>
      <h2>I believe in pushing boundaries, inventing greatness and solving problems.</h2>
      <p>Development and design is not just what I do, it's my life. It's who I am. Making things work well for users, making those things look awesome and making them come alive is my passion and my everything. I can't imagine doing anything else. It almost feels like a super power to make the internet every day.  </p>
